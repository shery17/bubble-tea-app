## About the project.

## Description of each page

The main page at http://localhost/bobas showcases the titles of the saved custom bubble tea in the main content as links. The header contains a navigation bar to the home page, add a new boba page and about page. This navigation bar is shown on every webpage.

### Boba showcase page
Clicking on a boba tea link from the homepage directs you to the showcase page of that individual custom bubble tea. Here it shows what ingredients the custom bubble tea has. There is also and edit and delete button. The edit button directs you to the edit page and delete button removes the saved boba from the database and homepage.

### Edit page
After clicking on the showcase page from the homepage and clicking the edit button. You can change your selection of ingredients for the custom boba tea and rename it. The save button will update the database and homepage.

## Additional features
### CSS
I have used CSS to style the webpages to be more colourful for a bubble tea app, I made a fully functional and clean navigation bar and all the webpages have been implemented with web responsive design in mind, shrinking the webpage adjusts the layout of the website. The colours chosen are complimentary to the links and buttons while still being clear and readable.

### Components
I used a layout component to make the navigation bar appear for every webpage so that all the main pages for the site can be reached from any webpage.
